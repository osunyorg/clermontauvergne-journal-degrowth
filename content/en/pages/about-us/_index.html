    <p>  <br>Degrowth  is organised as   a free, open-access, international, transdisciplinary, and peer-reviewed journal that focuses on advancing the goals of degrowth. It is published online in annual volumes, with rolling open submission set to be begin in early 2024. Organised as an international, independent, non-profit association, the editorial collective is decentralised across various countries. We meet regularly and operate following the principles of radical democracy.
