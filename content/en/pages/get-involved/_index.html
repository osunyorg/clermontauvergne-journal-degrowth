    <p>A journal is like a community garden, and there is no community garden without gardeners. That’s where you come in</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>First,  we're looking for writers : researchers sharing their latest scientific discoveries or their perspectives about specific issues; thinkers wishing to share their exploration of a topic in an essay; bookworms eager to write a review of their latest read; students excited to summarise their theses; doers who have a story to tell about a conference, a meeting, or anything else they feel might be relevant to the readers of this journal. This is a safe place to grow wild ideas; don't hesitate to  submit . Second,  we're inviting experts to review papers . Do you have expertise in a topic that relates to degrowth? If yes, get in touch; we're building a database of researchers in all career stages to take part in the review process. Thirdly,  we are looking for scholars to become editors . We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply; and especially people that are currently underrepresented in academia. As of now, our publishing capacity is very limited because we are only a few, but the more editors join us, the more papers we will be able to review.  Fourthly,  we are seeking copy-editors and production editors . We are proud to provide our authors with an extensive copy-editing service which opens up the possibility of publishing to more people, particularly those for whom English is not their first language. Volunteers do not need previous experience of academic publishing; these roles respectively require only a high level of confidence in the English language, or strong proficiency with Microsoft Word. Finally,  we are open to any volunteers who can help provide  organisational support  with tasks including administration, fundraising, or communications. Volunteers with particular skills - such as legal expertise - are very welcome, but we invite anyone to get in touch regardless of career stage, publishing experience or background. There is a place for everyone in this garden. If you are interested in joining the collective in any capacity  please fill out the form here by 10 March 2026 . Please get in touch with us if you have any questions ( info@degrowthjournal.org ).</p>
