    <p>A journal is like a community garden, and there is no community garden without gardeners. That’s where you come in</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>First,  we're looking for writers : researchers sharing their latest scientific discoveries or their perspectives about specific issues; thinkers wishing to share their exploration of a topic in an essay; bookworms eager to write a review of their latest read; students excited to summarise their theses; doers who have a story to tell about a conference, a meeting, or anything else they feel might be relevant to the readers of this journal. This is a safe place to grow wild ideas; don't hesitate to  submit . Second,  we're inviting experts to review papers . Do you have expertise in a topic that relates to degrowth? If yes, get in touch; we're building a database of researchers in all career stages to take part in the review process. Thirdly,  we are looking for scholars to become editors . We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply; and especially people that are currently underrepresented in academia. As of now, our publishing capacity is very limited because we are only a few, but the more editors join us, the more papers we will be able to review.  Fourthly,  we are seeking copy-editors and production editors . We are proud to provide our authors with an extensive copy-editing service which opens up the possibility of publishing to more people, particularly those for whom English is not their first language. Volunteers do not need previous experience of academic publishing; these roles respectively require only a high level of confidence in the English language, or strong proficiency with Microsoft Word. Finally,  we are open to any volunteers who can help provide  organisational support  with tasks including administration, fundraising, or communications. Volunteers with particular skills - such as legal expertise - are very welcome, but we invite anyone to get in touch regardless of career stage, publishing experience or background. There is a place for everyone in this garden. If you are interested in joining the collective in any capacity  please fill out the form here by 10 March 2026 . Please get in touch with us if you have any questions ( info@degrowthjournal.org ).</p>  <p>   <br>Remuneration We operate with very limited funding, and as such all roles in our editorial collective are fulfilled on a voluntary, unpaid basis.  Values and behaviour We expect members of our editorial collective</p>  <p> to uphold the values of the journal as outlined in our  Manifesto . This includes a commitment to the pursuit of degrowth and anti-capitalism, as well as more widely embracing our core values of openness, cooperation and intersectionality. Our discussions take place using consensus-based, sociocratic principles and we expect all editors to participate in this approach. Commitment All roles on our editorial collective require on average at least 1–2 hours of work per week, but this workload varies over time. Naturally, as academics and practitioners operating within a fast-moving society, our availability for unpaid activity also varies significantly. We therefore always endeavour to be flexible - and the more volunteers we have, the more flexible we can be - but we at least expect all our volunteers to stay connected to the work of the journal at all times, and to make up their commitment when possible.</p>
