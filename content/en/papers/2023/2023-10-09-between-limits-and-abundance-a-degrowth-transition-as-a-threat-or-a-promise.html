abstract: >-
  In this paper, I argue that the discourse around a degrowth transition may be conceptualized as following two distinct narratives, or narrative strategies: one that highlights a threat (or a challenge) to be overcome, and one that highlights a promise to be fulfilled. Whereas the former proposes that there are no ‘win-win solutions’ under current conditions of capitalism, the latter argues that ‘win-win solutions’ are very much in reach, if only one were to reconceptualize ‘winning’ in terms of non-materialist abundance. Arguably, both narratives are valid, but at the same time they lead to diametrically opposed conclusions on ethical demands: while the threat narrative implies an ‘ethics of constraint’, the promise narrative implies an ‘ethics of abundance’. I argue that being aware of the dialectical character of these two narratives that degrowth scholars typically make use of in different contexts will help to understand divergent policy advice and proposed leverage points, and it might help to avoid misunderstandings within the community and beyond.
