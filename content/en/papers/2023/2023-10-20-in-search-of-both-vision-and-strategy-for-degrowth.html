        <p>More than 1,000 texts have been published about degrowth in the last fifteen years, yet a thorough synthesis complementing the recent inventory of degrowth policy proposals by Fitzpatrick et al. (2022) was missing. Matthias Schmelzer, Andrea Vetter, and Aaron Vansintjan’s <i>The Future is Degrowth</i> fills this gap by providing an extensive account of degrowth, spanning from its visions to policy proposals to bottom-up strategies. The book is laid out as follows : Chapter 1 serves as an introduction, Chapter 2 gives a comprehensive definition of growth, Chapter 3 critiques growth from seven different perspectives, Chapter 4 elaborates different currents of degrowth and combines the different critiques and visions to formulate a holistic definition of degrowth, Chapter 5 suggests actions to get to a degrowth future, Chapter 6 shares examples of transformational strategies, and finally, Chapter 7 Degrowth Journal Volume 1 (2023) 00027 2 considers the gaps that degrowth still needs to address. In this book review, I will briefly summarize the chapters before providing some final reflections on the book. <br></p>
