abstract: >-
  Capitalism relies on various forms of violence that create and uphold injustice and alienation. Anarchist practices—such as disobedience and occupations—challenge this status quo by resisting oppression and imagining alternatives beyond the State. While degrowth scholarship has effectively analysed global inequalities, it must further engage with these movement experiences and explore the affective dimensions of collective struggle. In this context, this article discusses how acts of solidarity during moments of State oppression serve not only as resistance but as survival strategies against systemic violence. By referring to internationalist protests in solidarity with Palestine, the article argues for an emphasis on political emotions to understand and confront global capitalist violence. In order to move beyond ideological constraints to envision a world of radical interdependence and justice, degrowth needs to become part of a global movement for liberation, based on revolutionary bonds and collective self-defence.
