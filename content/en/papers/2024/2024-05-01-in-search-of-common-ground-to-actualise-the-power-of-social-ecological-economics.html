  <p>A review of Foundations of Social Ecological Economics: The Fight for Revolutionary Change in Economic Thought </p>

abstract: >-
  This book review discusses Clive Spash’s Foundations of Social Ecological Economics: The Fight for Revolutionary Change in Economic Thought. It summarises each chapter and highlights the book’s significance for degrowth scholarship. Additionally, it critiques Spash’s overly scholastic interpretation of judgmental rationality, which underestimates the significance of pragmatism in strategically important policy contexts. However, the review acknowledges the book as an unparalleled effort in outlining a consistent framework for social ecological economics grounded in an understanding of economies as social provisioning systems.
