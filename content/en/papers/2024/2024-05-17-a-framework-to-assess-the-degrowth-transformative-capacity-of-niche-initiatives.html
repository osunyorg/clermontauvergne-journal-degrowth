abstract: >-
  As humanity faces multiple mutually-reinforcing social-ecological crises, rhetoric on transformations abounds. However, transformations are normative, politically-contested processes that risk perpetuating, or even exacerbating, the ecological and socio-economic crises of today. We argue that transformations should seek to enhance human and non-human well-being within the planetary boundaries; a goal that is enshrined in degrowth theory. In this paper, we present an analytical framework that synthesises key concepts from transformations and degrowth literature against which a niche initiative’s degrowth transformative capacity can be evaluated. This is based on a set of 32 qualitative, codable criteria. We delineate the constitutive elements of degrowth transformative capacity based on five key elements: 1) Degrowth Goals and Visions, 2) Building Networks, 3) Empowerment and Learning, 4) Democratic Governance, and 5) Fair Resource Flows. We then illustrate the usefulness of this framework by presenting a comparison of seven energy communities in Greece, in terms of their degrowth transformative capacity. The framework can be seen as a descriptive starting point that can be expanded or adapted by academics and/or practitioners to explore degrowth futures and degrowth transformative capacity in other sectors (e.g., food or transportation) and contexts (e.g., Global South countries).
